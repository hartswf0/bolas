# library2 QA: part gates and pairwise seam tests

Every regularized part has to pass this stage before an assembler may use it. The stage has two layers:
1. Part gates (`gates.py`) test each part on its own. A part that FAILs is excluded from pairing.
2. Pairwise joint tests (`pairs.py` + `seam.py`) attach each part to the parts beside it, sweep the joint angle,
   and score the seam. The result is a compatibility matrix in `pairs.json`. Assemblers use only CLEAN pairs, and
   only inside their clean range.

## seam.py: the stable interface (the joint lab's fitness)

```python
from seam import score, facing_compatible, TOL
r = score(render_rgba, maskA, maskB, pivot, axisA, axisB, over='A'|'B',
          featuresA=[bool masks], featuresB=[bool masks],
          facingA=(view, facing), facingB=(view, facing), joint='neck'|'wrist'|'ankle'|'elbow'|'knee'|'generic',
          tol={...overrides...})
```

**Inputs.**
- All arrays share one pixel frame, with y pointing down.
- `maskA` and `maskB` are each part's full silhouette as placed, whatever is drawn on top.
- `pivot` is the joint point.
- `axisA` is a unit vector from the joint into A, along A's bone. `axisB` is the same for B.
- `over` names the part drawn on top.
- `features*` are painted features that must stay visible, for example a face oval or an off-joint brad. Only the
  under part's features are tested.

**Output keys.**
- `seam_w`: the unit length, equal to the smaller part's cross-section at the pivot. Every fraction below is
  relative to `seam_w²`.
- `gap_px`, `gap_frac`: background enclosed between the parts. It is computed as the morphological closing of the
  union minus the union, inside a disk of 0.9·seam_w. Holes painted inside one part (eyelet holes, the hollow
  chest) do not count.
- `width_A`, `width_B`, `width_ratio`: each part's own cross-section at the joint, measured across its bone at
  0.1·seam_w inside it. `width_ratio` = B/A, and a step is a ratio outside the joint's tolerance. For the neck, the
  torso's neck end may be 0.9–2.4× the head's neck (a collar wider than the neck); a neck wider than the collar
  fails.
- `exposed_A_frac`, `exposed_B_frac`: pixels of a part that lie beyond the joint, on the other part's side (an
  overlap tab or cut end), and outside the other part's silhouette.
  - When the under part's tab shows, the result is MUTILATED.
  - The over part's beyond-joint pixels, such as a collar rim or cuff, only warn, and only when they are large.
- `covered`: the largest hidden fraction of any under-part feature.
- `colour_dE`: CIE76 ΔE between the median colours either side of the visible seam contour. It only warns at
  joints where the material should continue (elbow and knee).
- `facing_ok`: False when the two (view, facing) tags cannot meet. That happens when the view families differ
  beyond their neighbours (front with three-quarter, three-quarter with side, back with three-quarter-back), or
  when the screen-left/right facings disagree.
- `verdict`: CLEAN, WARN or MUTILATED.
- `why`: the failing terms, the MUTILATED ones listed first.
- `spot`: where to circle the failure on a sheet.

`TOL[joint]` holds the thresholds:
- `gap_warn`, `gap_fail`;
- `exp_warn`, `exp_fail`;
- `cov_warn`, `cov_fail`;
- `ratio` and `ratio_fail`, each a (lo, hi) pair on width_B/width_A;
- `dE_warn`.

The joint lab can pass `tol=` to tune them. Changing a default here changes every verdict.

## Round 04: detectors of the drawn result (`detect.py`), validated against the blind critic
The joint lab found that the earlier tab_visible / light_rim / grommet_peek / colour_jump terms were about 0 on
renders where the critic named those defects. They are replaced in `seam.score` by detectors that measure the
composite. They run when the layers are passed, and the old values stay as diagnostics.
- **tab_cm2:** the visible area (cm²) of each part's pixels beyond the joint, on the other part's side, within
  6 cm: an overlap tab, tongue, lobe or cuff end that shows. It warns above 9.2.
- **light_rim2:** the fraction of light, low-saturation pixels (V > 170, S < 60) in a 0.5 cm band on both sides of
  the seam contour (the over part's outline lying on the under part). The band stays 0.25 cm inside the figure. It
  warns above 0.055.
- **Registration on the composite:**
  - `registration2_cm`: from the brad (sprite, or the part's own painted brad) to the nearest painted ring, using
    bbox centres, because a lit ring's colour mask is lopsided.
  - `crescent_cm`: the thickest band of ring brass still visible outside the brad.
  - `bare_brad`: a brad with no ring within 1 cm. It fails.
  - `grommet_peek2`: a ring 15–85 % visible, not concentric with the other part's ring. It warns.
  - A crescent above 0.74 cm warns, and a registration above 1 cm fails.
- **colour_dE2:** colour compared material to material (skin against skin, cloth/leather against cloth/leather),
  so black sleeves against black trousers, or a sleeve against a hand, are not counted. It warns above 15.

Validation: `validation/validate_critic.py` writes `validation/report.json`. It uses the 48 critic-judged renders
of joint-lab rounds 01–04, with the critic's named defects hand-read into `validation/critic_labels.json`. The fit
uses rounds 01–03, and R04 is held out. Round 01 renders carry no part layers, so the grommet test uses rounds
02–04 only.

| term | train P / R | R04 test P / R | all P / R |
|---|---|---|---|
| tab_visible | 0.55 / 1.00 | 0.50 / 1.00 | 0.53 / 1.00 |
| light_rim | 0.50 / 0.57 | 0.62 / 1.00 | 0.56 / 0.75 |
| grommet | 0.67 / 1.00 | 0.60 / 0.38 | 0.65 / 0.69 |
| colour_jump | 0.10 / 0.50 | – (1 label) | 0.08 / 0.33 |

The overall verdict does not reproduce the critic's CLEAN/MUTILATED call. The critic's CLEAN sheets still name
tabs, rims and grommets (CLEAN is a severity judgement), so "no term fires" calls 0 of the 9 critic-CLEAN sheets
clean. Agreement (0.81 overall, 0.75 on R04) equals the always-MUTILATED baseline.
- The terms are useful as **named-defect detectors**: tab has high recall, rim and grommet are moderate, and
  colour is weak (only 3 labels).
- They are not a calibrated clean/mutilated classifier.
- The tab precision of about 0.5 partly reflects the critic not naming every visible tab.

## gates.py: per-part tests
Each test returns `{result: pass|warn|fail, evidence, why}`. The overall `verdict` is the worst of the four.
- **cutoff**
  - The alpha touches the card border on a side other than the connection end.
  - Long straight outline segments (scissor cuts) run away from the connection end.
  - The part is short against the canonical size, e.g. crown→chin under 0.82× of height/8.
- **contamination**
  - Hands: a skin-tone gate. The dominant paint is compared with the character's head skin (median Lab of the
    skin-coloured pixels on its front, three-quarter and side heads). Above ΔE 20 it fails, unless fixes.json
    sets `glove_confirmed`. This catches the pale grey reserve hands.
  - Heads: the outline widens below the chin (shoulders or collar attached); the chin→pivot distance is over 14 cm
    (the pivot sits mid-neck); dark cloth sits in the neck zone.
  - Hands and feet: wrist, sleeve or shin material is present. These tests are added with their part types.
- **connection**
  - The pivot is off the centre-line of the cross-section.
  - No brad was found.
  - There is no overlap tab beyond the pivot.
  - The width at the pivot is recorded, so the neighbour can be matched.
- **identity** (is it actually this part?):
  - CLIP zero-shot reads the part from the card's cached embedding, over prompts for head, hand, forearm,
    upper arm, thigh, shin, foot, torso, pelvis and feature.
  - For limbs, hands and feet, the length is compared with the canon (`canon_deviation.length_ratio` from
    ../canon.json).
  - It fails when the length is under 0.5× or over 1.75× the canon, or when CLIP and the length both disagree.
  - Compound cards (shin + boot, forearm + hand) are rejected in fixes.json, and two-brad-segment cards are
    flagged `extra_brads_mid_segment`.
- **view**: the view tag is checked against the pixel test (for heads, the skin/hair centroid offset and the dark
  face box).

## pairs.py: the sweep

```
python3 shots/scion2/library2/qa/pairs.py poet head       # neck: head on torso (neck keypoint)
python3 shots/scion2/library2/qa/pairs.py poet hand       # wrist: hand on forearm (wrist)
python3 shots/scion2/library2/qa/pairs.py poet foot       # ankle: foot on shin (ankle)
python3 shots/scion2/library2/qa/pairs.py poet forearm    # elbow: forearm on upper arm (elbow)
python3 shots/scion2/library2/qa/pairs.py poet shin       # knee: shin on thigh (knee)
python3 shots/scion2/library2/qa/pairs.py poet upper_arm  # shoulder: upper arm on torso (shoulder_l/r by his side and the torso view)
python3 shots/scion2/library2/qa/pairs.py poet thigh      # hip: thigh on pelvis (hip_l/r)
python3 shots/scion2/library2/qa/pairs.py poet pelvis     # waist: pelvis on torso (waist pivot)
python3 shots/scion2/library2/qa/summary.py               # summary.json + sheets/summary.jpg
```

The sweep covers only the joint's ROM (`seam.ROM`), in steps of 15°. A view probe also attaches each part to
one neighbour of every view family at −30, 0 and +30. It records which families the part joins cleanly
(`view_probe` in results and pairs.json) and flags a tag that contradicts the behaviour.

1. Neighbours: up to 3 per part.
   - They must share the character, a compatible view family and a compatible facing.
   - They rank higher for the same costume, the same cut sheet, a brass-found joint and a neutral pose.
2. Attaching: both parts are canonical, so the neutral pose is the child pivot on the parent's joint keypoint with
   zero rotation.
3. The sweep covers the joint ROM (seam.ROM) in steps of 15°. A positive angle turns the child counter-clockwise on screen. Angles outside the ROM are N/A.
4. Z-order: the neutral pose is scored both ways (parent over child, child over parent) and the sweep uses the
   better one, recorded as `over`. The Skin Lab stack is only the first guess.
5. For hands, feet and limbs, neighbours are matched on his left/right side, not on view.
6. Outputs:
   - `results/<char>_<part>.json`: the gates, plus every pair-angle score.
   - `pairs.json`: for each child → neighbour pair, `clean_range` and `usable_range` and the failures per angle.
     `clean_range` is the contiguous run of CLEAN steps around 0. `usable_range` is the same with CLEAN or WARN
     steps.
   - `sheets/<char>_<part>_qa_NN.jpg`: one row per part.
     - The canonical part, then 1–3 neighbour strips at −60, −30, −15, 0, +15, +45 and +90.
     - Each tile is outlined green (CLEAN), amber (WARN) or red (MUTILATED), and the failing seam is circled.
     - The four gate results are printed under the row.
   - `sheets/<char>_<part>_qa_worst.jpg`: the worst pair-angles, with the summary counts.
